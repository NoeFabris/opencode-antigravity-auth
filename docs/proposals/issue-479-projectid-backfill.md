# Proposal: Auto-resolve and persist missing project IDs\n\n## Problem\nAccounts with refresh tokens but missing project IDs are skipped as missing_project.\n\n## Implementation\n- During account load, detect refresh-token accounts lacking projectId/managedProjectId.\n- Refresh access token, call loadCodeAssist, and persist resolved IDs.\n- Add short cooldown to avoid repeated failures in-session.\n\n## Edge Cases\n- invalid_grant refresh token\n- loadCodeAssist partial failures across endpoints\n- preserve manually configured project IDs\n\n## Verify\n- Fixture account without project IDs is backfilled after startup/login.\n- No repeated noisy retries within one session on repeated failure.
